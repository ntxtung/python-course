"""
Fact: the sub list is the continuous part of the list
Write a function maximum_sub_list that:
Input: (input_list: list[int])
Output: find the contiguous sublist (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum

For example:
input_list = [-2, 1, -3 , 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
output = 6
Explanation: [4, -1, 2, 1] has the largest sum = 6.
